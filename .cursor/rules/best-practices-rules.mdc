# General Rules

- Always avoid unnecessary code and complexity.
- Always avoid over-engineering and hardcoding.
- Always avoid unnecessary comments and documentation.
- Always avoid unnecessary logging and debugging.
- Always WRITE in ENGLISH, never write in other languages.
- Always consider responsive design and mobile-first approach.
- Always use the TAILWIND CSS Baires and Neutral colors palette, unless otherwise specified.
- Whenever you make UI/UX changes, always focus on something modern, cool, a well-rounded design with 3D elements, simple but cool animations, elegant elements. Always componentize things like buttons and inputs when needed and then reuse them. Let's focus on a very user-friendly "3D" website.
- When using 3D elements, use tools and libraries, image links such as: Spline, React Three Fiber, Drei, Three.js, whichever you think is most worthwhile.

## Code Quality

- Always write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly describe their purpose
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code
- Follow consistent code formatting and style guidelines
- Remove unused imports, variables, and dead code

## Error Handling

- Always handle errors gracefully with proper try-catch blocks
- Provide meaningful error messages that help with debugging
- Log errors appropriately for monitoring and troubleshooting
- Validate input parameters and handle edge cases
- Use appropriate error types and status codes

## Security

- Never hardcode sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or tokens
- Use environment variables for configuration and secrets
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated to avoid security vulnerabilities

## Performance

- Optimize database queries and avoid N+1 problems
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Minimize network requests and payload sizes
- Profile and monitor application performance

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Aim for good test coverage but focus on quality over quantity
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Test both happy paths and error scenarios
- Keep tests independent and deterministic

## Documentation

- Only write documentation for the code if asked by the user.

## Architecture

- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns appropriately
- Separate concerns and maintain loose coupling
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Design for scalability and maintainability
- Consider future requirements but avoid over-engineering
