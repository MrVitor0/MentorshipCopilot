# Project: Mentorship CoPilot (Context)

## Project Overview

Mentorship CoPilot is an internal micro-app developed for the BairesDev AI Hackathon. Its purpose is to optimize and scale the internal mentorship program, transforming a currently manual and fragmented process into an intelligent, centralized, and results-driven workflow.

The Problem to Solve
Based on direct feedback from BairesDev PMs, the current process suffers from two critical pain points:

Mentor Matching Difficulty: The specialized team struggles to find mentors for niche or highly specific technologies, leaving some developers without ideal support.

Fragmented Tracking: Mentorship progress is tracked across decentralized tools (Slack, spreadsheets, emails). This prevents PMs from having a clear, standardized view of their team's development.

The "Mentorship CoPilot" Solution
The CoPilot solves this by focusing on two core features:

Intelligent Matching: An AI that analyzes data (synthetic for the MVP) across all engineers to suggest the 3 most compatible mentors for each case, with a special focus on finding "hidden talent" in niche technologies.

Tracking Hub: A centralized dashboard that acts as the "source of truth" for progress, where PMs can see status at a glance and Mentors can log standardized session reports.

## MVP Route (UI) Structure

Below is the list of the 5 essential pages/routes for the MVP, including the rationale for each.

Page 1: PM Dashboard
Route: /dashboard

Purpose (The "Why"): This is the main view for the Project Manager. It directly attacks the "fragmented tracking" pain point. The page gives the PM a high-level, immediate overview of all active mentorships on their team, showing the progress status for each. It's the manager's "control center."

Page 2: Create Mentorship Request
Route: /request/new

Purpose (The "Why"): This is the start of the workflow and the "AI-Assisted Creation" interface. It's an intelligent form where the PM selects the mentee and describes the challenge. The text entered here serves as the direct input for the AI analysis.

Page 3: Mentor Recommendations
Route: /request/recommendations/:id (or similar)

Purpose (The "Why"): This is the "wow factor" screen and the core of our AI feature. After the PM submits the request, this page displays the analysis results: the Top 3 recommended mentors, complete with a justification for their compatibility. It directly solves the "niche matching" problem.

Page 4: Mentor Dashboard
Route: /mentor/dashboard

Purpose (The "Why"): A simplified view for the Mentor. The goal is to reduce friction. Instead of a complex dashboard, they see only the mentorships they are actively conducting, encouraging participation and timely reporting.

Page 5: Mentorship Workspace (Shared)
Route: /mentorship/:id

Purpose (The "Why"): This is the "source of truth" for a specific mentorship, visible to all stakeholders (PM, Mentor, Mentee). It's where the Mentor adds standardized session logs (replacing Excel/Slack) and serves as the data source that feeds the progress bars on the PM Dashboard.
